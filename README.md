# ReadingOptimization
To do list:
- [ ] Need to fork over toy instance
- [ ] Include personal use case
- [x] Iterate over 30 large instances
- [ ] Implement Solver Options for Gurobi
- [x] Descriptive Stats on basic solns
- [ ] Stats on DOE for sol w/ Options
- [ ] MPS file upload to NEOS
- [ ] Port to R for LPSolve comparison
- [ ] Modify scripts to use R input format (mps instance, time, Solver)

This project is separated across the following folders:
* Analysis
	* Image File with Plots for 30 large instances
	* R Script for analysis of 30 large instances
* Optimization Model Files
	* MPS files with random generated parameters
	* Python Script to generate and solve 30 instances
	* Goodreads csv file contraining base data
	* Modified CSV file for use with R (Solver as factors)
